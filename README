Welcome to my mess !

The goal of this repo is to share the (often very simple) scripts, modules and config files (and probably other things) i've made.
Most of them were made for my personal use only and are probably useless to you without slight modifications, but i hope they'll be usefull or inspiring...

There are absolutely no licences on all the stuff in this repo, you can use everything as you wish (or even not use them at all ! :) ), the goal is to share !
