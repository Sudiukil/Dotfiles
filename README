Welcome to my mess !

The goal of this repo is to share the (often very simple) scripts i've made.
Most of them were made for my personal use only and are probably useless to you without slight modifications, but i hope they'll be usefull or inspiring...

There are absolutely no licences on those scripts, you can use them as you wish (or even not use them at all ! :) )
