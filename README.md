# Dotfiles

This repo contains some of my dotfiles (config files). They are probably useless as is but should be easily reusable.

Everything in this repo is licensed under the WTFPL 2.0 license, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/Sudiukil/Dotfiles/blob/master/LICENSE) for complete copy.

## "Mess"

This repo used to be called "Mess" and contained scripts as well. They have been moved to the [Scripts repo](https://github.com/Sudiukil/Scripts).
