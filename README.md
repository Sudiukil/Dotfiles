Welcome to my mess !

The goal of this repo is to share the (often very simple) scripts, modules and config files (and probably other things) i've made.
Most of them were made for my personal use only and are probably useless to you without slight modifications, but i hope they'll be usefull or inspiring...

Everything in this repo is licensed under the WTFPL 2.0 license, see LICENSE for complete copy.

Note: Sorry for the french (cocorico !) non-translated parts in scripts/modules/config/whatever, it's painful to check it all every time i update them. However, comments will always be written in english :)
